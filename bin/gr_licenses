#
# Scans every production repo for its libraries and what licenses they provide.
# By default, provides a report (.csv) for each repo. Can take a while, since
# it does the analysis in a docker container, where it needs to bundle (and
# yarn client, and pip -r...) the repo first.
#
# Some repos are more difficult than others.  See the confluence page to
# get details of all the special cases.
#
# The report is based on ../policy/dependency_decisions.yml; if you need to
# work with that, the best thing to do at the moment is to use `dlf
# "license_finder -p && bash"` to get into a Docker container with the product
# in question, then use license_finder's commands to add licenses, whitelist
# them, or approve individual libraries.
#
# There is a companion Confluence page https://grandrounds.atlassian.net/wiki/x/F4C9DQ
#
# Dollar's Java code is too difficult to do at all right now. LicenseFinder
# doesn't do `ivy`, *and* `ivy` doesn't report many licenses -- sometimes
# because the packages used are so old, and sometimes because `ivy` doesn't
# seem to be getting everything maven has.
#
# Does *NOT* synchronize master in the repos in question; it just uses whatever
# clone you have.
